            <h1>Breaking In To Virtual Realty | Mr. Robot</h1>
            <p> <strong style="font-size: 20px;"> Ladies & Gentlemen, the Alderson siblings will now attempt to break in
                    to Virtual Realty without saying a single word.</strong> <br>
                From Season 4 Episode 5 "405 Method Not Allowed" On Christmas morning, Elliot burns the van and is
                picked up by Darlene. Elliot and Darlene, posing as an employee, break into Virtual Realty, the company
                that keeps the servers for Cyprus National Bank. Elliot installs a firmware hack that gives them 40
                minutes to get the information they need while temporarily disabling the security cameras. Nearly
                getting caught, Elliot triggers a power outage, which aids their escape. The security team calls the
                police when they realize they've been infiltrated, but only lays eyes on Elliot. He leads the police on
                a foot chase through Central Park. Darlene is able to walk out, now posing as a gym attendee, and pick
                up Elliot after he is hit by a car and leaps over a guard rail. Dominique is sent by Janice to the local
                police department to give the Dark Army control over the van investigation. While meeting with her
                family, the Central Park incident is on the news. Janice sends her out again to immediately capture
                Darlene and Elliot, seen on a traffic camera. Elliot texts Price that Tyrell won't be coming to the
                meeting. Price follows clues to the location of the Deus Group meeting that night and replies that it'll
                happen with or without Tyrell. Krista is confronted by Vera.</p>
